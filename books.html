        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008C9Z5YM"><h2>Hazardous Magic</h2></a> Grounders bring trouble. Constable Arax of the Tree People has enough trouble already, but when grounder troops show up at the edge of the forest looking for a lost cache of deadly war magic, the real trouble is just beginning.<br>
        In a world scarred by old magic and unlimited ambition, some questions are too dangerous to ask. If Arax is to protect his home and the people who live there, he may have to ask the most dangerous question of all.
