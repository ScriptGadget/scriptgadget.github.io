  <strong>Business Ghostwriting</strong> </br>

  A proven way for startup founders to educate your ideal customer
  about the unique problem they share, help them recognize
  that your product is the way to solve it, and convert them into
  lifelong customers (without wasting money on ads or influencers).

  <strong>Startup Technology Review</strong> </br>

  Technology is expensive and it's not unusual to find $10,000
  or more in cost and time savings just by looking at
  different approaches. This includes a one hour review of
  technology needs for your startup or established business.

  <strong>Software Development</strong> </br>

  Experience, flexibility, and a focus on essentials mean we can often
  accomplish together in one day what might otherwise take a week or more.
  I am experienced in transactional web and mobile development as well as
  embedded systems, distributed control systems, and Supervisory Control
  and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.</br>

  I prefer to track software development by the day rather than by the hour.
  If necessary, I can also bill at a traditional, hourly rate. My hourly rate
  begins at $150 depending on the type of work to be done. </br>

  A one hour, initial consultation is free. If I can provide a solution in that
  time, I will. I don't "save back" anything for billable time.
