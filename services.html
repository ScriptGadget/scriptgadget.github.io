  <strong>$249 - Startup Technology Review</strong> </br>

  Technology is expensive and it's not unusual to find $10,000
  or more in cost and time savings just by looking at
  different approaches. This includes a one hour review of
  technology needs for your startup or established business.
  Appointments available in person or via video chat.

  <strong>$800 - Software Development, One Day</strong> </br>

  Experience, flexibility and a focus on the essentials, mean we can often
  accomplish together in one day what might otherwise take a week or more.
  I am experienced in transactional web and mobile development as well as
  embedded systems, distributed control systems, and Supervisory Control
  and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.</br>

  I prefer to track software development by the day rather than by the hour.
  If necessary, I can also bill at a traditional, hourly rate. My hourly rate
  begins at $150 depending on the type of work to be done. </br>

  A one hour, initial consultation is free. If I can provide a solution in that
  time, I will. I don't "save back" anything for billable time.
